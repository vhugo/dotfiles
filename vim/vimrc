" My vimrc started as a copy of [Chris Toomey's][1] vimrc, and I'll improve it
" as I get more confortable with vim in my workflow. All of my vimrc style
" configurations into individual files organized by functionality. These
" live in ~/.vim/rcfiles.
"
" I am using Vundle to manage my plugins, which is configured below
" Each plugin is configured in its own file in ~/.vim/rcplugins
